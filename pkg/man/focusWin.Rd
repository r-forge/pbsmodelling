\title{Set the Focus on a Particular Window}

\description{
	Bring the specified window into focus, and set it as the active window. 
	\code{focusWin} will fail to bring the window into focus if it is called from the R 
	console, since the R console returns focus to itself once a function returns. 
	However, it will work if \code{focusWin} is called as a result of calling a function 
	from the GUI window. (i.e., pushing a button or any other widget that has a 
	function argument).
}

\usage{focusWin(winName, winVal=TRUE)}

\arguments{
	\item{winName}{name of window to focus}
	\item{winVal}{if \code{TRUE}, associate \code{winName} with the default window 
		for \code{setWinVal} and \code{getWinVal}}
}
